# Using Syzygy

The syzygy service is a set of computational tools made available through a partnership of the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Science \([https://www.pims.math.ca](https://www.pims.math.ca)\) and Compute Canada \([https://www.computecanada.ca](https://www.computecanada.ca)\).

Syzygy is pronounced like the start of "Sizzle" -- sizz eh gee. It means the [alignment of three or more celestial objects](http://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/31/science/science-watch-a-really-big-syzygy.html). In this book, it represents the alignment of text, math, and code in a convenient tool called a Jupyter notebook.

This eBook is a brief introduction on how to use these computing tools.

Code samples for the book can be launched on Binder. Click here:

If you have a Jupyter server \(such as XXX.syzygy.ca\) you may clone a github repository of all the code in this book using this command from your Unix/bash shell:

```
git clone https://github.com/mlamoureux/UsingSyzygy.git
```
