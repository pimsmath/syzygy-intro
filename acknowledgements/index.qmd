This eBook was written by Michael Lamoureux. The site was built by James Colliander with [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io/) using the [Material theme](http://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-material-docs), then converted to quarto by [PIMS staff](https://pims.math.ca).

The Syzygy service is brought to you by The [Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences](https://www.pims.math.ca) in collaboration with and on infrastructure from the [Digital Research Alliance](https://alliancecan.ca/en) (formerly Compute Canada) and [Cybera](https://cybera.ca).
