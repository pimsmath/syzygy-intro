## Unix tricks

In the background, Jupyter Hub runs on Unix, and you can access the Unix bash
shell to do all your Unix magic from the command line. Just open a new
"terminal" from the front page of your Jupyter server.

However, I am not a big Unix fan. I prefer to point and click. So here are a few
tricks I've learned to avoid the terminal commands.


## Unix and Magic in a Notebook.

While running a Jupyter Notebook, you can access many Unix commands directly,
without opening a terminal window using so called "magic" commands. These
commands always start with the percent sign %.

Here are a few familiar Unix commands you might find useful:

  - `%ls` -- to list all files in the current directory
  - `%cd` -- to see the name of your current directory
  - `%cd dirname` - to change directory (enter the name of the directory you want)
  - `%cp oldfile newfile` -- to copy the oldfile onto a newfile
  - `%rm filename` -- to remove (delete) the file named "filename"

Thankfully, you can move all around the directory tree using these magic
commands. So for instance, you might want to copy a file from Directory1 into
Directory2. You would use a command like this:
  - `%cp /home/myusername/Directory1/filename /home/myusername/Directory2/filename`

Where "myusername" is whatever the Jupyter server has called your account. Use
the `%cd` (with no arguments) followed by `%pwd` to see the path to your home
directory (including your user name.)

In a python 3 kernel you can also run arbitrary unix commands by putting an
exclamation mark "!" at the beginning of a line, e.g.
```
!cp /home/myusername/Directory1/filename /home/myusername/Directory2/filename
```
Whenever possible, prefer the '%' for, but ! is also available.

## More Magic in a Notebook

The magic system is much richer than just the unix commands listed above. A good
reference to what is possible is available in the [ipython
documentation](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html)

With a double percentage sign %% you signal to Jupyter that the whole cell is to
be interpreted accordingly. For instance a cell like this:

```python
%%latex
\[ \int_0^1 f(x) \,dx = F(1) - F(0) \]
```
tells the notebook to read the whole cell as latex code, and render it
accordingly.

$$
 \int_0^1 f(x) \,dx = F(1) - F(0)
$$

To see all defined magic commands available in a Jupyter notebook, type the
(magic) command
- `%lsmagic`

Magics can help with debugging, working with files, defining macros and much
much more.
