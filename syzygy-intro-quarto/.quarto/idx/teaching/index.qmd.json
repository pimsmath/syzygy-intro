Asking a large group of students to\n    do the same task simultaneously may exhaust the available resources and make\n    your experience very slow. When machines are under extreme resource\n    pressure, they may decide to shutdown processes that they don't have any\n    hope of servicing. Try to plan ahead by splitting up and spreading out\n    tasks.\n\n  * We have a very small support team. We try hard to make sure our services are\n    always available, but we still have planned and unplanned outages. Normally\n    we will try to resume the service as soon as possible, but this depends on\n    lots of factors, and we can't always do it the same day.\n\nFor these reasons we recommend against using syzygy for e.g. Timed exams and we\nurge you to be careful when planning submission dates for homework etc.\n\n\n### NBGitPuller\n[NBGitPuller](https://github.com/data-8/nbgitpuller) is a very useful server\nextension which uses specially constructed URLs to guide students through the\nprocess of cloning out git repositories. As an example, an instructor might\nmaintain a collection of notebooks, which they will update and extend throughout\nthe term. By giving a specially constructed URL to their students, each student\nwill automatically be given their own copy of the files at the start of term and\ncan keep it in sync (without losing their changes) as the term progresses.\n\n\nTo use it, you need to construct long and complicated URLs, but fortunately\nthere is a handy [nbgitpull link\ngenerator](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/link) to help you. The\ngenerator will ask for your JupyterHub server (use\n`https://uxxx.syzygy.ca/jupyter/` where `uxxx is the name of your university), a\ngithub repository, and (optionally) file you would like to open once the\nrepository has been cloned. After you fill all that information in, the\ngenerator will produce a long complicated link which might look like...\n\n```\nhttps://uxxx.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpimsmath%2Fpublic-notebooks&urlpath=tree%2Fpublic-notebooks%2Fpath%2Fto%2Ffile.ipynb&branch=master\n```\n\nWhen the student visits the link for the first time the repository will be\ncloned out into their home directory. When they visit the same link later in the\nterm git will \"pull\" in any changes from the repository and try to merge them\nsafely with the student's existing work (see below for more details of how the\nmerge works).\n\n\nThe strange characters in query string are HTML encoded versions of the familiar\nascii characters. For instance, `http://` becomes `http%3A%2F%2F`. It is\nimportant that these values are properly encoded or they might be ignored by the\nhub.  Some URL shortening services (e.g. bit.ly) will strip the encoding and may\nbreak the links, so where possible please distribute the full (encoded) link\nproduced by the generator or use a shortening service which doesn't strip the\nencoding (e.g. [tinyurl](https://tinyurl.com/)). The parameters in the query\nstring are...\n\n  * **`repo=https:%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpimsubc%2Fpublic-notebooks`** is required and\n    specifies the URL of the git repository you want to clone.\n  * **`branch=master`** is an optional git branch name (default \"master\")\n  * **`urlpath=tree%2Fpublic-notebooks%2Fpath%2Fto%2Ffile.ipynb`** is an optional argument that specifies the path of the directory / notebook inside the repo to launch after cloning. By default, the base directory of the linked Git repository is opened. It's recommended that you specify a path to a specific file if you want that file to open after users click the link.\n\nNBGitPuller is implemented as a notebook extension so doesn't depend on any\nspecific kernel. It will happily clone out *any* repository, so you can use it\nwith R, Python or any other kernel installed on your syzygy instance.\n\n### nbgitpuller service demonstration\n\nThe following link demonstrates the nbgitpuller service on pims.syzygy.ca by\ncloning out a [simple python3 example notebook](https://github.com/pimsmath/public-notebooks/blob/master/nbpuller-example1.ipynb).\nTo try the service out, simply click on the following link:\n\n  * [nbgitpuller example](https://pims.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpimsmath%2Fpublic-notebooks&urlpath=tree%2Fpublic-notebooks%2Fnbpuller-example1.ipynb&branch=master) (You may want to open this in a new tab...)\n\nClicking on the link should trigger the following actions\n\n  1. Take you to [pims.syzygy.ca](https://pims.syzygy.ca)\n  2. Authenticate you via google (if you aren't already)\n  3. Start your server (if it isn't already started)\n  4. Clone out a copy of the notebook to\n     `public-notebooks/nbpuller-example1.ipynb`\n  5. Open the notebook in your browser.\n\nThe full URL used in the link is\n```\nhttps://pims.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpimsmath%2Fpublic-notebooks&urlpath=tree%2Fpublic-notebooks%2Fnbpuller-example1.ipynb&branch=master\n```\n\nSplitting this apart, we can see the pattern described above:\n\n  * **`https://pims.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull`** refers to the\n    syzygy instance (pims.syzygy.ca).\n  * **`https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpimsmath%2Fpublic-notebooks`** tells nbpuller which\n    repository to use (`https://github.com/pimsmath/public-notebooks`).\n  * **`branch=master`** specifies the master branch within the repository.\n  * **`urlpath=tree%2Fpublic-notebooks%2Fnbpuller-example1.ipynb`** tells nbpuller to open that file (`nbpuller-example1.ipynb`) automatically after cloning.\n\n\n### How NBGitPuller Works\n\nAs its name implies, NBGitPuller works by constructing and executing git\ncommands. [Git](https://git-scm.com) is a distributed version control system\nwhich lets you keep track of changes and merge them with other people's.  The\ninitial click on an NBGitPuller link will take the user to the relevant\nJupyterHub, log them in (if necessary) then try to grab a clone of the\nrepository. If you're not familiar with git, this is essentially a copy of the\nremote files in the repository with the advantage that both the user and the\nrepository owner can continue to modify their own copies of the files\nthen ultimately merge them together (inside the user's clone). To do all of this\nNBGitPuller implements a subset of the git commands so that subsequent clicks on\na link by the user will try to merge changes according to this plan:\n\n\n  * If content has changed in both places, prefer local (user) changes over remote\nchanges.\n  * If a file was deleted locally but present in the remote, remote file is\nrestored to local repository. This allows users to get a 'fresh copy' of a file\nby just deleting the file locally & clicking the link again.\n  * If a file exists locally but is untracked by git (maybe someone uploaded it\nmanually), then rename the file, and pull in remote copy.\n\nSince git is doing all of the heavy lifting here it is also possible to use git\ndirectly to do more advanced tasks (e.g. different merging strategies) with the\ncaveat that mixing ordinary git commands and NBGitPuller is not a good idea.\nOnce you start using git \"manually\" for that repository you should avoid using\nthe NBGitPuller links as the merging patterns will almost certainly be\ndifferent. As the [NBGitPuller\ndocumentation](https://github.com/data-8/nbgitpuller) says \"[this] is going to\ncause surprises on an ongoing basis, and should be avoided.\"\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nJupyterHub can be a great resource for teaching and we we encourage people to\nuse syzygy to help teach their classes, but you should keep the following\nthings in mind:\n\n  * syzygy.ca hosts are *shared services*.
