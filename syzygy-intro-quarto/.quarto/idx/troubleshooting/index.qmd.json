The\ntips below may help you get things going again without further intervention, but\nif not, please contact jupyter@pims.math.ca\n\n\nRestarting your server can clear up a number of issues. If you see any of the\nfollowing messages, please try restarting your server.\n\n * `500 internal server error, permissi9n failure checking authorization, I may\n   need a new token`\n\nTo restart your server, click on the Control panel button at the top right of\nthe notebook. This should display a page with a red \"Stop My Server\" button.\nA few seconds after clicking the button, the red button should turn green and\nsay \"My Server\", click it again and you server should begin starting up again.\nIt can take around 30 seconds for your server to restart.\n\n## Broken Configuration Files\n\nJupyter (and Python, and Julia ...) store configuration files in your home\ndirectory, and from time to time these configuration files can become broken.\nThe simplest fix for this is to simply delete the configuration files and\nrevert back to the default configuration. In most cases the files are stored in\nhidden directories (e.g. .local), and the trick is just knowing where they are,\nhere are some common ones\n\n  * `~/.jupyter` - Jupyter Notebook configuration file\n  * `~/.local` - Locally installed python packages (`pip install --user\n    XXXX`)\n  * `~/.julia` - Julia packages and configuration files.\n  * `~/R` - R packages and configuration files.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nThese files are unrecoverable once deleted\n:::\n\nIf you have determined that files in one or more of these locations is causing a\nproblem for you, you can delete them using the UNIX rm command. From inside a\nnotebook you can do e.g.\n\n```shell\n!rm ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py\n```\nOr from the terminal\n```shell\nrm ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py\n```\nChanges to the notebook configuration will only take effect once you restart\nyour server (see above).\n\n## Out of Storage\n\nThe current default storage allocation for users is 1GB. If you find that you\nare getting out of storage messages or are unable to save files, you may have\nreached the quota. To recover from this, please email jupyter@pims.math.ca with\nyour username and the name of the server you are using.\n\n## Missing Output\n\nThe notebook uses a tool called nbconvert to create PDF (and other) versions of\nnotebooks you have created for export. On some syzygy hosts when you run the\nexport, you will find that the output cells from your code are missing and you\ncan only see the input cells. This is because a `pre_save` hook is\nbeing used on that server to scrub output before saving (or exporting)\nnotebooks. The reason for this is that it makes using git with notebooks much\nsimpler. If you decide that you would like to keep the output cells in your\nnotebook when saving, you can overrride this default by creating or modifying\nthe `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` in your home directory.\n\nFrom inside a python 3 notebook you could do\n```shell\n!mkdir -p ~/.jupyter\n!echo \"c.FileContentsManager.pre_save_hook = None\" > ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py\n```\n\nThe current pre_save hook looks like\n\n```python\ndef scrub_output_pre_save(model, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"scrub output before saving notebooks\"\"\"\n    # only run on notebooks\n    if model['type'] != 'notebook':\n        return\n    # only run on nbformat v4\n    if model['content']['nbformat'] != 4:\n        return\n\n    for cell in model['content']['cells']:\n        if cell['cell_type'] != 'code':\n            continue\n        cell['outputs'] = []\n        cell['execution_count'] = None\n\nc.FileContentsManager.pre_save_hook = scrub_output_pre_save\n```\n\nif you decide that you would like to scrub the output instead.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nFrom time to time you might experience problems with the syzygy.ca service.
