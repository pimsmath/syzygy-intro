There is a great deal of information\nabout Jupyter available at the [Jupyter project](https://jupyter.org/).\n\nThere are four key concepts to master:\n\n  - the Hub\n  - the Notebook\n  - Markdown Language (in a Notebook) \n  - Computing (in a Notebook).\n\nThis chapter discusses all four.\n\n\nYou get to the Hub by logging into the syzygy.ca service and clicking the button\nto \"Start My Server.\"\n\nThe Hub is a page that lists all your files and folders. It looks like this:\n\n![Hub image](/img/assets/Hub.png)\n\nAs you can see, the Hub looks a lot like the list of files and folders you would\nsee in the Finder on MacOS, or in the File Explorer in Windows. \n\nAt the top right corner of this front page is a \"Control Panel\" that lets you\naccess your Jupyter server, to turn it on or off. Also is the logout button, to\nend your session.\n\nThe main body is the list of folders and files that you have on your server. \n\nClick on a file or folder to open it. Use the checkbox on the left to select a\nfile, then do something with it. For instance, you can choose to rename it, copy\nit, stop it from running, or delete it.\n\n\nIt is a good idea to create folders at the top level, to organize your work into\nusable spaces. It turns out it is hard to move a file once it is created. (More\non this below.) So you should start by organizing your folders and files at the\ntop level.\n\nNear the top right, you see the upload button, which allows you to upload a file\nfrom your computer onto the Jupyter Hub. You can upload any file, including any\ndata files or image files you might wish to analyse.\n\nAlso near the top right is the \"New\" button, which allows you to create a new\nfolder or file. You can make text files, notebook files in Python, Julia or R,\nor open a Unix terminal window. \n\n## Moving files between folders\nIt's not documented, but there is a way to move files and folders in and out of\nvarious folders directly from the Hub.\n\nSelect a file listed in the Hub by clicking on the square box at the left of the\nfile's name. You are then given the option to \"rename\" the file. Click on the\nrename button, and then enter one of the following:\n\n  - `newname`  -- to give the file the new name\n  - `../oldname` -- to move the file up and out of the current folder, into the\n    previous forder\n  - `foldername/oldname` -- to move the file into the folder called \"foldername.\"\n    This folder should already exist (because you created it earlier with a \"new\n    folder\" command).\n\nThese renaming methods also work to move folders and their contents.\n\nTo move across several branches in the directory tree, you need to know the full\npath name of your files and where they are to go. This means you need to find\nout the name of your root tree structure. A fast way to do this is to use the\nmagic command `%cd` in a notebook.\n\nOpen a notebook, click on an empty cell, and type `%cd`, hit shift-return. It\nwill return the director root name. Typically something like `/home/username` or\n`/home/usernumber`.\n\nYou can now use this to move a file into any folder. Just rename the file\nsomething like `/home/username/folderA/filename`. (the folderA better exist\nalready, for you to move something into this.)\n\n\n\n## Using Notebooks\n\nFrom the Hub, you can click on a Notebook (a files with the suffix .ipynb) or\ncreate a new one with the \"New\" button. You need to pick a computing language\n(Python, Julia or R) when you create a new Notebook; for now, just choose\n**Python 3**.\n\nThe Notebook will look something like this. \n\n![png](/img/assets/Notebook.png)\n\nAt the top is the name of the notebook (in this case, \"Untitled\"). You can click\non that name and edit it to whatever you like. \n\nJust under the title is the menu bar, which allows you to do many things with\nthe Notebook, including saving it, downloading it to your own computer, editing\nit, inserting new cells, and so on. \n\nThere is also an icon bar of menu short cuts. All of them are pretty obvious. \n\nBelow the menu controls is the Notebook content, which consists of a sequence of\ncells. Each cell can contain Markdown text or computer code. You select which\nkind of content for that cell from the little icon in the icon bar at the top.  \n\nIn the example illustrated here, the first cell is just text. It says \"This is\nan example of a Notebook.\" The second cell is Markdown text, including a math\nformula in LaTeX format. It starts \"Here is an example of some math...\"\n\nThe third cell shows the math formula as a real math formula, with an integral\nsign and all. The math is just typed in (like in the second cell), and then you\nhit \"shift-return\" on the keyboard to typeset the math. \n\nThe final few cells show some code, that loads in some plotting tools and makes\na simple plot. \n\n  \n\n\n## Pretty Text and Math (Markdown Language)\n\nOne great feature of the Jupyter Notebooks is that they can contain formatted\ntext, and mathematics, using the Markdown language.\n\nMarkdown is a rich language: a quick introduction to it is available here:\nhttps://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/\n\nSome quick points.\n\n### Editting and typesetting\n\nYou simply type your text and Markdown symbols into a cell, and hit\n\"shift-return\" to typeset the cell into pretty text (and math). Click on the\ncell again to undo the typesetting, so you can edit and fix your text. Make\nsure, of course, that you have marked the cell as \"Markdown\" and not \"Code.\"\n\n### Headers\n\nHeaders are made by starting the line with one or more hash marks \\#\n\n\\#### This is a level-4 header, in text form\n##### This is the resulting header\n\n### Emphasis\n\nAdd emphasis by surrounding text with asterix or underscores.\n\n\\* italics \\* and \\*\\* bold \\*\\*:  *Italics* and **bold**\n\n### Lists\nType this:\n\n\\* Apple\n\n\\* Orange\n\n\\* Pear\n\nto get a list like this:\n\n* Apple\n* Orange\n* Pear\n\n\n### Web links\n\nType this: \\[GitHub](http://github.com)\nto get a clickable link [GitHub](http://github.com)\n\n### Mathematics\n\nUse the dollar sign \\$ to indicate the start and end of TeX code for your math.\n\n```\nHere is a basic integral: $\\int \\cos(x) dx = \\sin(x)$\n```\nHere is a basic integral: $$\\int \\cos(x) dx = \n\\sin(x)$$\n\n### Images\n\nHere is some code to embed an image from the web:\n```\n![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)\n```\n\n![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThe syzygy computing service is an implementation of the Jupyter Hub on\ndedicated hardware accessible over the web.
