(If it doesn't start automatically,\nclick on the \"Start Server\" button.) Once the server is running, you will be\npresented with a list of files and folders that exist in your account. This is\ncalled the Hub, and is a view like the Finder on a Mac, or the File Explorer on\na Windows computer. \n\nFrom this Hub, you can click on files and folders to open them, you can select\nthem and take actions like renaming them, duplicating them, or removing them.\nSome of the files will have the suffix .ipynb, which stands for \"iPython\nNotebook.\" Despite the name, the Notebook might have nothing to do with Python\n-- it is there for historical reasons. \n\nNotebooks are files containing formatted text, math formulas, and computer code.\nMost of the time you will be creating and working with Notebooks in syzygy,\nEach Notebook has a collection of cells, which you create, edit and run. \n\nSo keep this as your focus for your work -- you will work in Notebooks, and you\nwill create pieces of text, math, and code to use. \n\nHowever, sometimes you need to know that in the background of the Jupyter Hub is\na Unix machine that does all the work. In the PIMS case, this is running on\nhardware from Compute Canada, or Cybera.\n\nTo access the Unix shell, you can open a terminal from the Hub, and do all the\nusual Unix bash shell operations. You can't access superuser commands (`sudo`,\netc.) but you can do just about everything else you like in Unix. If you are an\nexperienced Unix user, feel free to open a terminal and browse around. \n\nPersonally, I try to avoid using the Unix shell, but there are times when it is\na must. (For instance, to install certain packages, or to access files on Github\nor on remote machines.) There are notes on how to do this later in this book. \n\n## Moving files around\n\nAt some point you will want to reorganize the many files and folders you have in\nyour Jupyter Hub.\n\nIf you like Unix, you can always open a new terminal and move files around using\nthe `mv` or `cp` commands. \n\nIf you want to avoid Unix, you can use the  Hub's naming system to move files around. \n\nSelect a file in the Hub by clicking on the square box at the left of the file's\nname. You are then given the option to \"rename\" the file. Click on the rename\nbutton, and then enter one of the following:\n\n  - `newname`  -- to give the file the new name\n  - `../oldname` -- to move the file up and out of the current folder, into the\n    previous folder\n  - `foldername/oldname` -- to move the file into the folder called \"foldername.\"\n    This folder should already exist (because you created it earlier with a \"new\n    folder\" command).\n\nThese renaming methods also work to move folders and their contents.\n\nTo move across several branches in the directory tree, you need to know the full\npath name of your files and where they are to go. This means you need to find\nout the name of your root tree structure. A fast way to do this is to use the\nmagic command `%cd` in a notebook.\n\nOpen a notebook, click on an empty cell, and type %cd, hit shift-return. It will\nreturn the director root name. Typically something like `/home/username` or\n`/home/usernumber`.\n\nYou can now use this to move a file into any folder. Just rename the file\nsomething like `/home/username/folderA/filename` (`folderA` had better exist\nalready, in order for you to move something into it).\n\nSee the [Unix Tricks](/unix-tricks/) section on Unix magic for more tips on\nmoving files.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nWe quickly show you how to log in, and a few other pointers. \n\nClick on the subsections to read further. \n\n\n## Logging In, and Browsers.\n\n<img src=\"/img/sfu-jupyter.png\" alt=\"SFU login\" \n\twidth =300\" align = \"right\">\n\n\nLog into the syzygy service by using your home university credentials or Google\ncredentials.
