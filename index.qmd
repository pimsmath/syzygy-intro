**syzygy.ca** is a project of the [Pacific Institute for the Mathematical
Sciences](https://www.pims.math.ca), [Compute Canada](https://computecanada.ca)
and [Cybera](https://cybera.ca) to bring Jupyter notebooks to researchers,
educators and innovators across Canada. This site is a brief introduction on how
to use these computing tools.

Syzygy is pronounced like the start of “Sizzle” – sizz eh gee. It means the
alignment of three or more celestial objects. In this book, it represents the
alignment of text, math, and code in a convenient tool called a Jupyter
notebook.
